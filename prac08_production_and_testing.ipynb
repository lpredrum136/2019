    "The practical note for this week introduces you to the practical aspect of Python machine learning models in production environment. Production environment is where a model gets new data and makes predictions to help make decision. We will discuss differences of between models in training phase and production phase, how to build a data pipeline, how to serialise models and other tips related to production. This topic is a seldom one to discuss in an university unit, but I believe it is equally as important as other theoretical components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned how to perform preprocessing and cleaning on a dataset, building and validating model, selecting important features and conducting both supervised and unsupervised data mining tasks. This practical will introduce you on concepts beyond the training, what happened after your model is finished and how to ensure your model is production ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure sufficient time to finish your workload, anything discussed in this week will not be graded unit components (assignment/exam).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Training a basic model\n",
    "\n",
    "As a foundation to start this practical, we will first train a `LogisticRegression` model. The dataset used will be the `veteran.csv` dataset that you are very familiar with (used from practical 1-5). We will not explain too much of this stage as it is quite similar with practical 1-3 steps, please read the comments on the code for step-by-step instructions."

    "## 2. Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "An important step before deploying our model into production system is to ensure all steps performed in data preparation and feature engineering are consistent and complete. With many replacement, imputation, transformation and dropping steps performed before a dataset is clean, it is common to make mistake, lose important actions and have \"data leakage\". `sklearn` provides a method to consolidate all steps into one object through `pipeline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In building `sklearn` pipeline, there are 4 important classes used:\n",
    "1. `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`, used as parent classes to build `Transformers`. Transformers are classes responsible for applying a preparation or transformation step onto a dataset. A Transformer is the smallest component in a `Pipeline`.\n",
    "2. `Pipeline`. Pipelines are a method to pack each `Transformer` in your logic sequentially into one function call, making it easier to perform training and predictions. Given 3 transformers A, B and C, a Pipeline will run the input dataset through A, pass the output to B, then C, and so on (in order of A->B->C). With a Pipeline, you can ensure consistent steps are applied into to training, validation, test and future data. Pipeline class also implements fit, transform and prediction functions, automating many of the function calls commonly used by a model. You can build a Pipeline through `Pipeline()` class initialisation or `make_pipeline` function. We will use `make_pipeline` mainly for simpler call.\n",
    "3. `FeatureUnion`. FeatureUnions are quite similar with pipelines. While pipelines run each step sequentially, `FeatureUnion` join each transformer in paralel. Instead of A->B->C, FeatureUnion will return a larger set of results from [A, B, C]. Similar with Pipeline, we will also use the equivalent function of `make_union`.\n",

    "Another option is to replicate data processing steps and export the model weights in other language. This is commonly used where high performance/low prediction latency is necessary. As we have learned in previous practicals and lectures, after training process is finished, many data mining models can be represented as series of weights and connections (LogisticRegression being the best example). These weights can be easily exported/serialised and used in other technologies/languages. A clear disadvantage of using this deployment option is there is way more work required as the production has to re-implement the model exactly as it was during training. With many complicated operations and data preprocessing steps in a pipeline, this implementation process can be prone to bugs."

    "## 4. Other tips\n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses various performance tips that you could use to help your model works better in production setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Batch prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many production systems, real-time atomic predictions is not required. Often prediction tasks can be stashed and delayed to be then processed in batch basis. Batch processing allows the model to take advantage of vectorised computations and SIMD instructions (single instruction, multiple data), which speeds up computational performance significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refer a real-life example, GoCardless, a YCombinator funded startup which focuses on cashless payments, uses machine learning models to perform fraud detection activities. Most payment transactions in the company take 1-2 days, therefore, batch prediction is very suitable for their business case. In the end, the fraud detection is run a nightly-cron job (every 24 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Vertical scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling refers to the process of accomodating growing volume of computing task by increasing the computing power of one task. Typically vertical scaling is implemented through buying a faster, better computer. Vertical scaling can allow a production system to handle more data mining task requests by running each task faster serially or using multithreading/multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3. Horizontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Different with vertical scaling, horizontal scaling spreading the large number of requests over large number of commodity hardware. This methodology is the key to scale your infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner. Horizontal scaling fits data mining model deployments really well as many predictive tasks are stateless (e.g. each prediction/row are considered to be unrelated from one to another), which mean large number of predictions can easily be distributed over many models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4. Testing and retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "After a deployment, a model must be monitored periodically. As training often took place using a snapshot of training data, the model prediction quality typically degrades as the environment shifts away from the conditions that were originally captured. After a certain timeframe, the error could grow to be significant, thus the model has to be retrained or replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this condition, there are two common methods to update the model. First, you could periodically collect newer data and train a \"challenger\" model. Both old model and the new challenger are then tested on new stream of data. If the challenger manages to outperform the older model, this new model and its pipeline are then deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second paradigm is to use online training. In online training, newer data that becomes available in a sequential order is used to train and update model, fifferent from batch learning which waits for a large set of training data. Online learning is commonly used for training a model over a very large dataset that does not fit the memory. Online trained models are also capable of adapting to newer patterns in data, leading to common usage in time-related tasks such as stock price predictions."
